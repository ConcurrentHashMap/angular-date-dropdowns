Date dropdown fields for angular. Main use case is for entering date of birth.

Creates three dropdown fields - Day, Month and Year.

Day contains options 1 - 31
Month contains options January - December
Year contains the last 100 years

If a user enters an incorrect date (e.g. 30 February) the date will be automatically updated to the nearest previous correct date (e.g. 28th February or 29th if it is a leap year).
